# Neutralize.css 

Neutralize.css is the beautiful love-child of Nicolas Gallagher's "Normalize.css" and Eric Meyer's "Reset.css".

The original idea behind Neutralize.css was to develop the ultimate CSS reset by combining the best of both worlds, as well as a few of my own personal tweaks and fixes. Neutralize.css is free to use and, to quote Meyer, "all explicitly in the public domain".

I consider Neutralize.css a mere starting point. Styling, like anything in the world really, is a matter of personal opinion. You should feel free to tweak, edit and finetune the included stylesheet for your personal needs – or if you feel satisfied that my interpretation of the ultimate reset meets your expectations, just go grab yourself a copy of the minified version and get coding right away!

I owe Nicolas Gallagher and Eric Meyer all the credit for tracking down both common – as well as some not so common – browser rendering errors, bugs and inconsistencies and coming up with genious fixes for the whole world to enjoy.

Happy coding!
