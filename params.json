Neutralize.css is free to use and, to quote Meyer, \"all explicitly in the public domain\".\r\n\r\nI consider Neutralize.css a mere starting point. Styling, like anything in the world really, is a matter of personal opinion. You should feel free to tweak, edit and finetune the included stylesheet for your personal needs – or if you feel satisfied that my interpretation of the ultimate reset meets your expectations, just go grab yourself a copy of the minified version and get coding right away!\r\n\r\nI owe Nicolas Gallagher and Eric Meyer all the credit for tracking down both common – as well as some not so common – browser rendering errors, bugs and inconsistencies and coming up with genious fixes for the whole world to enjoy.\r\n\r\nHappy coding!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [npm](http://npmjs.org/): `npm install --save neutralize.css`\r\n* [Component(1)](https://github.com/component/component/): `component install redcodk/neutralize.css`\r\n* [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install --save neutralize.css`\r\n* [Download](http://redcodk.github.io/neutralize/latest/neutralize.css).\r\n* [Download minified](http://redcodk.github.io/neutralize/latest/neutralize.css).\r\n\r\nYou should include Neutralize.css _before_ any other stylesheets in your header.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Browser support\r\n\r\n*  Google Chrome (latest)\r\n*  Mozilla Firefox (latest)\r\n*  Mozilla Firefox 4\r\n*  Opera (latest)\r\n*  Safari 6+\r\n*  Internet Explorer 9+\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credit:\r\n\r\n\"Normalize.css\" by Nicolas Gallagher – http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/\r\n- Copyright © Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal (MIT)\r\n\r\n\"Reset.css\" by Eric Meyer – http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/\r\n- No license (public domain)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
